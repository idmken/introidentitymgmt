Primary repository for building an Intro to Identity Management Course

The objective of this repository is to begin the journey of creating an open source course focused on Identity Management.

I'm open to feedback on structure, but for now I'm going to follow a modular approach based on topics I leveraged in my first iteration of the course.
The hope was that this could be taught cafeteria style, so that instructors could pull content on a desired basis.
